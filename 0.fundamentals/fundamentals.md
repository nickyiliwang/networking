#S1 - Architecture - Remote Access

##VPN Connections

S2S VPN



* ONPREM communicate over an existing internet connection
* Encrypt all of the traffic with a VPN appliance, or a firewall, or a router, or another device that can handle these types of site-to-site VPNs. 

Client VPN (host to site)



* Laptops at coffee shop

Host to host 



* Laptop to laptop

##VPN Protocols

PPP



* Authentication, compression, error detection, multilink, **no encryption**
* Physical networking: telephone lines, mobile phone, serial cables
* L2 with only modem, **needs more functionality for remote access over IP**

PPTP (PP Tunneling)



* Can encrypt PPP connections

SSL VPNs (secure socket layer)



* Web protocol
* Can authenticate with username and password

IPSec



* secure IP packets there at layer 3. 
* Every packet can be authenticated and encrypted through the tunnel, exposing very little. 
* Security and integrity: prevents someone from replaying that traffic and trying to use that to gain access to our network. This encryption and packet signing functionality maintains both the security, and itâ€™s ensured that only this traffic is going to be used once through that tunnel.
* Standardized with vendor devices.
* Authentication Header: 
    * Used to make sure that the data is authenticated on both sides. 
* Encapsulation Security Payload:
    * ESP secures the data and makes sure that all of the information is also encrypted.
